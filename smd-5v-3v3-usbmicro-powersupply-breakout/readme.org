* SMD 5V & 3V3 USB Micro Power Supply Breakout
- A filtered 5V USB VBUS line and 3V3 line via an LDO (all with ESD protection)

- MPNs left blank are for generic parts, e.g. the THT header pins (any two pin 2.54mm pitch THT header will suffice)
- FB1 can be interchanged with another appropriately sized ferrite-bead depending on the filtering needs (see below)
*** Alternative FB1 MPNs
- FB1 / 300R @ 100MHz: HI2220R301R-10 (currently using in project)
- FB1 / 100R @ 100MHz: HI2220R101R-10
- FB1 / 550R @ 100MHz: 7427928551

- Can see the 5V waveform varies by approx 50-60mV (sloping down from 5V and then periodically jumping back to 5V)
- With the more positive ripple being around 30mV
