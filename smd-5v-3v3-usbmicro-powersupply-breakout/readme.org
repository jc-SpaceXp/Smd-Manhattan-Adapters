- MPNs left blank are for generic parts, e.g. the THT header pins (any two pin 2.54mm pitch THT header will suffice)
- FB1 can be interchanged with another appropriately sized ferrite-bead depending on the filtering needs (see below)
*** Alternative FB1 MPNs
- FB1 / 300R @ 100MHz: HI2220R301R-10 (currently using in project)
- FB1 / 100R @ 100MHz: HI2220R101R-10
- FB1 / 550R @ 100MHz: 7427928551
